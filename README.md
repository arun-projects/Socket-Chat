# Socket Chat

- In this lab we will be working to create a real-time chat application.
- The front end is already done for you and can be downloaded here.
- You will be working in js/app.js to develop the code to interact with the web socket server.
- A working socket server can be found here: http://arunchatserver.herokuapp.com/
- This front end expects that your chats get sent as objects in the format:

```
{
	name: "Arun",
	message: "Hello world!"
}
```

- **Bonus:** Use your knowledge of front end JavaScript to change the page title when a new chat is received.
